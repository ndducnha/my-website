            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">I am currently an Associate Research Fellow in the SOCRATES project (Software Security with a focus on critical technologies), which focuses on Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and VPN at Deakin University, Melbourne, Australia. I received my PhD from Deakin University, and Master's degree from Queensland University of Technology, Australia. During my PhD, I published papers in Q1 cybersecurity journals, and some of my work was funded by the Department of Defense, Australia. I have been awarded a place on the QUT Dean's list for excellent academic performance two consecutive times in 2020 and the School of Information Technology Higher Degree by Research award for the 2022 Academic Year, recognizing the highest research and academic merit. I also secured a prize in the 2022 Country to Country CTF (C2C) Cybersecurity Challenge, a prestigious international competition hosted by MIT and organized by INCS-CoE with leading universities. During my teaching and research assistant roles at Deakin University, I gained significant experience in AI and machine learning applications, particularly in the context of cybersecurity.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Mentoring and supervising higher-degree research students has been one of the most fulfilling parts of my academic career. My ability to inspire and lead student has led to successful research outcomes and significantly contributed to our growth as scholars. Currently I am also working with other PhD students at Deakin with Dr. Sood in contributing and sharing our research.</p>
            <ul>
                <li style="text-align: justify;">At Deakin University, during the third year of my studies I have had the privilege of guiding a new student (Mr. Gurpreet Singh) of my PhD supervisor (Dr. Keshav Sood). During weekly meetings, I contributed to developing and refining his research questions, helped him navigate the complexities of academic research journey, provided mentorship as well as shared my own research experience with him for him, etc. I am glad to mention that the supportive environment we have created resulted in a joint publication (publication number 2) which is demonstrated evidence of my ability to supervise HDR candidates. </li>
                <li style="text-align: justify;">During my postdoc, I had the opportunity to guide a Master's student, Mr. Michael, supervised by Dr. Sood. I supported him in writing and revising a book chapter, which has been preliminarily accepted and will be published by Elsevier (Scopus).</li>

            <h2>Research collaboration</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">These experiences have given me insight into the process of securing research funding, and working on critical technologies has positioned me well to pursue future funding opportunities. My colleagues and I submitted an internal grant application focused on mitigating software supply chain security issues and received a successful outcome. I am closely working with Dr. Sood on submitting an external grant application (as co-lead) to the Department of Defence, which is an extension of Dr. Sood’s previous project.</p>
